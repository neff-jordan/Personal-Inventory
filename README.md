## Overview
The Personal Inventory Management System is a Spring Boot application designed to manage a personal inventory of products. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to add, list, update, and delete products from the inventory. This project uses Spring Boot for backend services and a PostgreSQL database for data persistence.

## Objective 
The primary objective of this project was to gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals of how frameworks operate, particularly within the context of Spring Boot. By developing a Personal Inventory Management System, the project provided practical experience in leveraging the features and capabilities of the Spring framework to build a functional and user-friendly application. Through this hands-on approach, key concepts such as dependency injection, data persistence with JPA, and service-layer interactions were explored, offering valuable insights into the design and implementation of modern software applications.

## Features
> Add Products: Log new products into the inventory with details such as name, type, location, and quantity.

> List Products: View a list of all products currently in the inventory.

> Update Products: Modify details of existing products based on their name.

>Delete Products: Remove products from the inventory based on their name.

## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot: Framework used for building and running the application.
- PostgreSQL: Database used for persisting product data.
- Java: Programming language used for application development.
- The application will start and display a command-line interface for interacting with the inventory.
